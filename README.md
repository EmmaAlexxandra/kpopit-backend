# Kpopit Backend

Kpopit is a community-driven K-pop app designed to centralize fan activity, highlight multi-stan engagement, and offer tools like bias boards, curated playlists, polls, and more â€” without ads or microtransactions.

This is the **backend service**, built with TypeScript + Express and Dockerized for local and cloud deployment.
